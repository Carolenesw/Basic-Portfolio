    <p>Since 2004, I wanted to study I.T but was always afraid because of my fair of maths. Fastfoward fifteen years later, I am now embarking on my I.T studies/career. My background is in business adminstration but I was introduced to Information Technology as part of my bachelor's degree where I studied Business Adminstration with a major in Information Systems and Management. I chosed that because I thought it was easier and would help exposed me to programming. Little did I realzed the program was only theoritcal. Hence very little exposure. </p>
